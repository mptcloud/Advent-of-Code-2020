# Advent-of-Code-2020

A repository to hold my attempts at solving 2020's Advent of Code programming problems. Most of my work will be run via Jupyter Notebooks using Python. An emphasis has been placed on readability and code conciseness.

This work has been inspired by Peter Norvig's own solutions to AoC 2016, 2017, and 2018. I hope to fill in the gaps and get to those contests for which he hasn't provided solutions in his own repository.
